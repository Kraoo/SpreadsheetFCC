# Functional Programming Spreadsheet

This project is a functional programming spreadsheet designed to perform various calculations and operations using functional programming concepts. It allows users to input formulas using a syntax similar to Excel formulas to perform calculations and manipulate data.

## Features

- **Functional Programming Paradigm**: The spreadsheet is built using functional programming principles, allowing for easier maintenance, scalability, and readability of the codebase.
- **Support for Mathematical Operations**: Users can perform basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Statistical Functions**: The spreadsheet supports statistical functions such as sum, average, and median, providing users with tools for data analysis.
- **Array Operations**: Users can manipulate arrays of numbers, including filtering for even numbers, extracting the first or last two elements, checking for the presence of a specific number, and removing duplicate values.
- **Random Number Generation**: The spreadsheet can generate random numbers within a specified range.
- **Cell Referencing**: Users can reference cell values using alphanumeric identifiers similar to Excel.
- **Error Handling**: The system includes error handling to manage potential edge cases and invalid input.

## Implementation Details

- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: The spreadsheet is implemented using HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality.
- **Infix Expression Evaluation**: The system evaluates infix expressions to perform mathematical calculations, ensuring proper order of operations.
- **Recursive Evaluation**: Formulas entered into the cells are recursively evaluated to handle nested functions and references to other cells.
- **Event Handling**: The spreadsheet updates automatically when cell values change, recalculating dependent cells as needed.
- **Support for Edge
